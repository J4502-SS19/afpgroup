        <h1>Being a Fellow</h1>
    </div>
    <!-- end header div -->
    <p>The Alfred Friendly Press Fellowships are six month professional fellowships offered once a year to professional journalists from developing countries and emerging markets. Friendly Fellows work full time at U.S. host news organizations while developing their journalism skills.</p>

		<h4>Benefits to Fellows</h4>

    <p>Working and living in another country is a challenge that fellows not only overcome but embrace. The benefits are personal as well as professional.</p>
		<p>Friendly Fellows learn to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improve skills in gathering information, interviewing and writing.</li>
        <li>Add social perspective to business and political reporting.</li>
     		<li>Write more balanced news articles, more polished feature stories and more in-depth analytical pieces.</li>
				<li>Improve written and spoken English.</li>
				<li>Become more vigorous and confident journalists.</li>
				<li>Gain insight into American culture, business and politics.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Participation in the Friendly Fellowship enhances career development at home—future fellowships, promotions, new jobs, etc. Our fellows have gone on to become journalism leaders in their newsrooms and around the world.</p>
		<p>During their time here, our fellows meet a wide range of journalists and newsmakers. Press Partners staff, Alfred and Jean Friendly Foundation Board members and the Friendly family are integral to the Friendly Fellowship experience. These personal ties last a lifetime.</p>

		<h4>Fellow Responsibilities</h4>

    <p>The fellowship is a full-time training experience, and fellows are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and responsible manner. Fellows work between 35 and 50 hours per week for their U.S. host news organizations. Outside the newsroom, fellows are expected to give at least two talks in the community – at local schools, press clubs, community groups, etc. Press Partners also requires fellows to maintain a fellowship blog, detailing both their personal and professional experiences.</p>
