    <p>Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.

A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!</p>

    <p>No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!</p>
