    <h1>Yan Zhang</h1>
		<div class="location">USA Today</div>
    <p>Yan Zhang writes for Hong Kong’s largest native online media for Chinese readers worldwide. She formed The Initium’s reporting team from mainland China, reports on topics such as urbanization and economic reform and writes “what China’s officials didn’t want the world to know”</p>
    <p>“Working under China’s Great Firewall for eight years, I’m thinking how the Wall affects the world, and how journalists respond to such influence,” Zhang said. “The best way to defend freedom is to continue to tell the truth. … I call my experience ‘peeling the onion’. I strip off the outer layer of the truth like peeling the onion skin, and show the core to the public.”</p>
    <p>Vivian Wu, Hong Kong Bureau Chief of BBC World Services, said Zhang has produced “outstanding” stories explaining a rapidly transiting China to the readers. “Her angle is always international and comparative, never constrained to a local view,” Wu said. “For example, she has reported how the Internet empowered Chinese young mothers seek optional challenges for safe milk formula and children products through global e-commerce platforms.”</p>
    <p>Zhang will work on the Money team at the USA Today and be based in the Washington, DC, headquarters.</p>
    <p>Zhang’s fellowship is funded by Bill and Christy Gautreaux, Norm and Lynette Siegel, and George Hanson.</p>

    <h1>Danish Raza</h1>
		<div class="location">Minneapolis Star Tribune</div>
    <p>Danish Raza’s reporting at the Hindustan Times, India’s second largest English language daily newspaper, focuses on social justice, gender and caste violence.  Assignments range from covering the Maoist insurgency to national politics.</p>
    <p>“His articles display a passion to cover humanitarian issues with a nuanced approach,” HT’s editor-in-chief, Sukumar Ranganathan, wrote. “He is able to grasp complex issues.  Boiling down policy matters successfully requires a mastery of the subject. …Victims and survivors, rather than experts and aid workers, do most of the talking in his articles.”</p>
    <p>Raza recently was promoted to assistant editor and has experience teaching journalism ethics and law to college students. He will work at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. By the end of his fellowship, he intends to produce a handbook for journalists, “Covering Muslims in India.”</p>
    <p>“Based on my experience of covering Muslims, Islamic affairs in India, combined with the insights gained at the host newsroom (during the fellowship), I wish to help news organisations back home become pluralistic and inclusive, particularly in their portrayal of Muslims,” Raza said.</p>
    <p>Raza’s fellowship is funded by the Patrick and Janna Stueve Foundation.</p>

    <p>At Joy News, Baidoo produces news content for radio, TV and online platforms. His multimedia stories focus on issues including health, climate change, environmental problems and food security.</p>
    <p>His story on bad roads connecting farms in Ghana to markets won the Food Sustainability Media Award organized by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He was selected to attend the Global Climate Reporting Program administered by the International Center for Journalists this year and was Ghana’s business journalist of the year in 2015 and 2016.</p>
    <p>After a dilapidated school in rural Ghana collapsed and killed six children, “a series of stories I did moved the government and philanthropists to put up new structures for the entire community,” Baidoo said.</p>
