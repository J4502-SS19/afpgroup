		<h4>Tribute Gift</h4>
			<p>To honor an individual, such as a prominent journalist, newsroom or other organization. Please consider giving a gift in honor of or in memory of one of the brave international journalists dedicated to informing their citizenry and holding their governments accountable.</p>
		<h4>Tribute Gift as an Alfred Friendly Fellow Alumni</h4>
			<p>Each year a small group of journalists from abroad, unknown to one another, travel parallel roads during a six-month fellowship in the United States â€“ the annual class of Alfred Friendly Fellows. We know that even after returning home the collegiality among Fellows is alive and well, sparked by shared circumstances then and now. Please consider the possibility of joining forces with your fellow Fellows on our behalf.</p>
			<p><strong>Please consider a donation to honor your host newsroom mentor or your Alfred Friendly Fellow Alumni Class.</strong></p>
		<h4>Stock Gift</h4>
			<p>This is a favorite of holiday giving for maximum impact: turn your stock into an investment in the Alfred Friendly Press Partners.</p>
			<p>It may be to your advantage to make a gift of appreciated stock rather than cash in order to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Avoid paying capital gains tax on the increased value of the stock, and</li>
					<li>Receive an income-tax deduction for the full fair-market value of the stock at the time of the gift.</li>
