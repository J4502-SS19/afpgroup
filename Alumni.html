		<h2 align="left">What our alumni say about our program:</h2>

    <p><b>“The Alfred Friendly and Daniel Pearl Foundation fellowships made me realize I could go that extra mile to prove I am a competent journalist. My experience in the US was priceless in the sense that I will return with a vast knowledge to share with my home newsroom.”</b></p>
		<p> - <i> Aida Ahmad, Malaysia, 2012, hosted by Los Angeles Times (Daniel Pearl Fellow)</i>
		<p><b>“It was the highlight of my career, so far. I made some of the most important friends of my life during this fellowship and have spent some of the most beautiful and full moments of my life here. I will never be able to wash away the images and experiences of these five months from my mind. It was more than a learning experience for me.” </b></p>
		<p> - <i> Aoun Sahi, Pakistan, 2010, hosted by Wall Street Journal, Atlanta Bureau (Daniel Pearl Fellow)</i></p>
		<p><b>“I have high hopes now for more serious, more courageous journalistic practice. It was great, really.”</b></p>
		<p> - <i>  Amr Emam, Egypt, 2007, hosted by San Francisco Chronicle (Daniel Pearl Fellow) </i></p>
		<p><b>“… the Alfred Friendly Fellowship has blessed me with such a lasting legacy. For almost two years I have been benefiting from the journalism training in your country. My six-month experience in Washington and Denver has taught me to be a more aggressive – and versatile – reporter, and that’s what I’m doing.”</b></p>
		<p> - <i> Huanxin  Zhao, China, 2002, hosted by Denver Rocky Mountain News </i></p>
		<p><b>“As an Alfred Friendly Fellow you’re more sure of yourself…you feel you can adapt to the writing style of any paper or magazine in any part of the world.” </b></p>
		<p> - <i> Doyin Adedeji, Nigeria, 1998, hosted by The Kansas City Star </i></p>
		<p><b>“The program was invaluable. It gave me a view of America and the press there that I would never have gained, no matter how many articles or books I read.” </b></p>
		<p> - <i>C.K. Meena, India, 1988, hosted by The Baltimore Sun </i></p>
		<p><b>“Alfred Friendly Press Partners made me a complete journalist.”</b></p>
		<p> - <i>Ranee Mohamed, Sri Lanka, 1987, hosted by St. Petersburg Times</i></p>
